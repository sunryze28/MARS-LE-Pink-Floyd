# MARS-LE-Pink-Floyd
Create a recipe for your very own Pink Floyd song! Packed with references to the band’s best (and goofiest) lyrics!

This project was created using the MARS-LE project, a fork of the official MARS MIPS simulator created by John Edelman, Jun Law, and Dominic Dabish. MARS-LE can be found at https://github.com/johnaedelman/MARS-LE and the original MARS can be found at https://dpetersanderson.github.io/

This project can be used by cloning the MARS-LE project and copying the files PinkFloyd.java and PinkFloyd.jar into ~/MARS-LE/mars/mips/instructions/customlangs/ . Both key files from this project can be found in ~/MARS-LE-Pink-Floyd/lang/

Additional documentation regarding the implementation of this language's instructions can be found in ~/MARS-LE-Pink-Floyd/PinkFloyd_Reference_Sheet.pdf
